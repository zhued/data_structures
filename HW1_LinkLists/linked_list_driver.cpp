  // As you can see, for function calls that take a node*, such as
  // report, we just pass in a node* directly.

  // For functions that take a node** (that's a pointer-to-a-pointer),
  // we need to use the address-of operator, the ampersand. So,
  // append(&head, child) is right.

  // This should give you a good starting point to fill in the rest of
  // this driver. Writing a good testing program is an art. Remember
  // that there are many functions to write, meaning you should
  // consider writing lots of code here (or even test functions) that
  // tests them.
